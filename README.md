# StormX Debit Card Design

## What are we doing?
StormX will be launching their first debit card which will allow users to earn Crypto Cashback anywhere VISA is accepted. The classic StormX memberships will be incorporated into the debit cards so that the higher the membership you have, the higher the cash bac you will earn on the debit card purchases.

## StormX Mission
We are focused on the mass adoption of crypto by helping people earn in crypto doing things they are already used to doing. For example, playing games on their phone and shopping online. We believe this is the best way to approach mass adoption since buying crypto is still thought of as niche, risky and confusing. Wouldn't it be great if you could get rewarded for doing every day things?!

## Requirements
1. Design 6 debit cards according to [Visa's standards](https://partner.visa.com/site/explore/card-designer.html).
2. Design the cards according to US region standards. Use the card builder to get an idea of what the differences are. You can make it vertical or horizontal. Put the numbers on the front or back, etc.

4. Each card should incorporate the corresponding membership badge. Files attached in this repo.
  * Purple - Rabbit (This is the base card which does not require STMX and thus no membership. The card simply allows the user to spend the STMX that they load onto it.)
  * Bronze - Cobra
  * Silver - Hawk
  * Gold - Tiger
  * Platinum - Hippo
  * Diamond - Whale

## Submission
1. Submit the raw file (adobe, sketch, etc.) used to overlay on Visa's card builder.
